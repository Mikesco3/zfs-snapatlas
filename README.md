# ZFS Snapshot Atlas

A tool for analyzing and managing ZFS storage usage by chunks of snapshots. This script helps you understand where your storage is being consumed by snapshots and provides targeted deletion capabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Version Disclaimer

**Version: 20250814 (Beta)**

This tool is currently in **BETA** and should be used with caution, especially the deletion functionality. Please:

- **Test carefully** on non-critical datasets first
- **Report any issues** you encounter
- **Don't fully trust it yet** - always verify before running deletion operations
- **Backup important data** before using deletion features
- **Use debug mode** (`-v` flag) to preview operations before executing them

The deletion logic is particularly sensitive and may have edge cases that haven't been fully tested. Use at your own risk.

## What It Does

ZFS Snapshot Atlas analyzes your ZFS snapshots and groups them into manageable chunks, then calculates how much space each chunk is consuming. It provides two main modes:

- **Chunk Mode (default)**: Shows the reclaimable space *if you were to delete an entire chunk of snapshots* (i.e., the space that would be freed by removing all snapshots in that chunk).
  - *Note:* "Chunk Mode" does **not** refer to the space between chunks, but rather the space that would be reclaimed by deleting the snapshots *within* each chunk.
- **To-Latest Mode**: Shows reclaimable space from each chunk to the most recent snapshot

The script can also delete specific chunks or sub-chunks, making it easy to reclaim storage without losing all your snapshots.

## Features

- üîç **Storage Analysis**: See exactly how much space each chunk of snapshots is consuming
- üéØ **Targeted Deletion**: Delete specific chunks or sub-chunks instead of all snapshots
- üìä **Flexible Chunking**: Divide snapshots into N chunks or use fixed chunk sizes
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Operations**: Dry-run mode by default with confirmation prompts for deletions
- üîß **Debug Mode**: Verbose output for troubleshooting and understanding

## Installation

### Short method
Run the following with root privileges command to download the script:
```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/bin/zfs-snapatlas https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mikesco3/zfs-snapatlas/main/zfs-snapatlas.sh && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/zfs-snapatlas
```

## Quick Start: Reclaim ZFS Snapshot Space in 4 Steps

Is your ZFS pool filling up unexpectedly? Old snapshots are often the culprit. This guide walks you through using `zfs-snapatlas` to find which snapshots are consuming the most space and how to safely remove them.

### Step 1: Find the Dataset with High Snapshot Usage

First, let's identify which ZFS dataset is using the most storage for snapshots.

Run this command to see a breakdown of space usage:
```sh
zfs list -o space
```

Look for datasets with a high value in the `USEDSNAP` column. In this example, `rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0` is using `34.3G` for snapshots, making it a good candidate for cleanup.

```
NAME                            AVAIL  USED   USEDSNAP  USEDDS  USEDREFRESERV  USEDCHILD
...
rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0        977G  61.5G     34.3G   27.2G             0B         0B
...
```

### Step 2: Get a High-Level "Atlas" of Your Snapshots

Now, let's get a high-level view of where that space is going. The script groups your snapshots into "chunks" (groups of 10 by default) and estimates the space you would **reclaim** by deleting each chunk.

Run the script on your target dataset:
```sh
./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**What the output means:**
*   `chunk 1`: A group of the 10 oldest snapshots.
*   `[00-09]`: The snapshot index numbers in this chunk.
*   `34.3G`: The estimated space you would get back if you deleted these 10 snapshots.

```
Analyzing snapshots for dataset: rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
Chunk size: 10

=== SUMMARY: Chunk reclaim sizes ===
chunk 1	[00-09]	20240902_before-Upgrades                  	34.3G
chunk 2	[10-19]	autosnap_2025-08-12_05:00:49_hourly         	0B
chunk 3	[20-29]	autosnap_2025-08-12_15:00:52_hourly         	0B
...
```
In this case, the oldest chunk of 10 snapshots is holding onto `34.3G` of data. The other chunks aren't holding any unique data. Let's investigate `chunk 1`.

> **Tip:** You can change the chunk size. For example, to use chunks of 5 snapshots:
> `./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 5`

### Step 3: Drill Down into a Problematic Chunk

The first chunk contains `34.3G` of reclaimable space. To get more detail, we can break it down into smaller **sub-chunks**.

Let's analyze `chunk 1` by breaking it into sub-chunks of 2 snapshots each. Use the `-t <chunk_number>,<sub_chunk_size>` flag:

```sh
./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 -t 1,2
```

The output now shows that `sub-chunk 1-1` (the first sub-chunk of chunk 1) is the one holding almost all the data.

```
Operating on chunk 1 [0-9] with 10 snapshots
Processing with sub-chunk size: 2 snapshots (5 sub-chunks)

=== SUMMARY: Sub-chunk reclaim sizes (from chunk 1) ===
sub-chunk 1-1	[00-01]	20240902_beforeUpgradingMint                	34.3G
sub-chunk 1-2	[02-03]	autosnap_2025-02-07_00:00:24_daily          	48K
sub-chunk 1-3	[04-05]	autosnap_2025-06-25_18:06:42_daily          	32K
...
```

### Step 4: Safely Delete Snapshots and Reclaim Space

Now that we've pinpointed the two snapshots consuming space, we can delete them.

To delete a specific sub-chunk, use the `-D <chunk>,<sub-chunk>` flag. This command targets `sub-chunk 1-1` for deletion.

```sh
./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 -t 1,2 -D 1,1
```

The script will always ask for confirmation before deleting anything. It shows you exactly which snapshots will be removed and how much space you'll reclaim.

```
üóëÔ∏è  DELETE CONFIRMATION
========================
Sub-Chunk:      1-1
Reclaim space:  34.3G

Snapshots to delete:
  - 20240902_beforeUpgradingMint
  - autosnap_2025-02-06_00:00:24_daily

Are you sure you want to delete these snapshots? (y/N):
```

Type `y` and press Enter to delete the snapshots and free up your storage.

> **Pro-Tip:** Use the `-v` flag for verbose output to see the exact `zfs` commands the script is running. Always double-check the deletion plan before confirming!

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Chunk Re-Alignment After Deletion**
> After you delete a chunk, the script re-calculates the chunks on the next run. If you delete `chunk 1`, the old `chunk 2` will become the new `chunk 1`.
>
> **Always run a fresh analysis before each deletion** to ensure you are targeting the correct snapshots. Do not rely on chunk numbers from previous runs.

## Additional Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis

**Analyze snapshots with default chunk size (10):**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**Analyze with custom chunk size:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 5
```

**Verbose output for debugging:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -v rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 10
```

### Chunking Strategies

**Divide snapshots into exactly 3 chunks:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -d 3 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**Divide into 4 chunks with verbose output:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -v -d 4 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

### Analysis Modes

**Chunk mode (default) - shows reclaimable space by deleting snapshots within each chunk:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 10
```

**To-latest mode - shows space from each chunk to most recent:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -l rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0 10
```

### Sub-Chunk Analysis

**Analyze only chunk 4, divided into sub-chunks of 1 snapshot each:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -d 4 -t 4,1 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**Analyze chunk 4 with sub-chunks of 2 snapshots each in to-latest mode:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -l -d 4 -t 4,2 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

### Deletion Operations

**Delete chunk 1 (with confirmation):**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -D 1 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**Delete chunk 1 without confirmation:**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -y -D 1 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**Delete sub-chunk 3 of chunk 1 (requires -t flag):**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh -t 1,5 -D 1,3 rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

**Delete ALL snapshots (with strong warnings):**
```bash
./zfs-snapatlas.sh --delete-all rpool/data/vm-180-disk-0
```

## Output Format

The script outputs a summary table showing:
- Chunk number
- Snapshot range (indices)
- First snapshot name
- Reclaimable space

Example output:
```
Most recent snapshot: auto-2025-01-15_12:00:00

=== SUMMARY: Chunk reclaim sizes (chunk mode: reclaim space per chunk) ===
chunk 01	[00-09]	auto-2025-01-01_12:00:00                    	1.2G
chunk 02	[10-19]	auto-2025-01-05_12:00:00                    	856M
chunk 03	[20-29]	auto-2025-01-10_12:00:00                    	2.1G
```

## Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable debug mode (verbose output) |
| `-l, --to-latest` | Calculate reclaim from each chunk to most recent snapshot |
| `-d N, --divide-by N` | Split snapshots into N chunks (overrides chunk_size) |
| `-t N,M, --target N,M` | Operate only on chunk N, with M snapshots per sub-chunk |
| `-D coords, --delete` | Delete snapshots. Coordinates are required (e.g., `-D 1` or `-D 1,3`) |
| `--delete-all` | Delete ALL snapshots from the dataset (use with caution) |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompts (use with `-D` or `--delete-all`) |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Small chunks may show unreliable totals** due to ZFS shared block accounting. Use larger chunks or `-l/--to-latest` mode for more accurate space calculations.

üí° **Tip**: Use larger chunks or `-l/--to-latest` mode for more accurate space calculations.

üóëÔ∏è **Delete**: Use `-D` with coordinates to target specific chunks (e.g., `-D 1` or `-D 1,3 -t 1,5`).

## Requirements

- ZFS filesystem with snapshots
- Bash shell
- `zfs` command available
- `shred` command (optional, for secure temp file deletion)


## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve error handling and edge case detection
- [ ] Add more flexible chunking strategies (e.g., by date, size, or custom rules)
- [ ] Support for more advanced deletion patterns (e.g., keep every Nth snapshot)
- [ ] Refactor code for modularity and easier testing
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Write more comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Package for easier installation (e.g., as a Homebrew or Debian package)
- [ ] Eventually: Turn this into a TUI (Text User Interface) using `dialog` or similar tools for selecting the zfs dataset against which to run it and interactive snapshot management (something similar or inspired off of `ncdu`)

## The Problem & Story

I fell in love with ZFS and snapshotting, but over time discovered that I was having issues figuring out where the storage was being taken up by snapshots. Usually, I'd be trying to zero in on the issue because something alerted me that the drive was becoming too full.

Initially, I'd take a scorched earth approach and delete almost all of my snapshots because the usual `zfs list -r -t snap` would never really show me the full picture. That was until I stumbled across an obscure mention of `zfs destroy -nv dataset@oldsnapshot%newersnapshot` and how that would give me an idea of the space that could be reclaimed by deleting everything between those two snapshots.

After looking for such a tool and not finding one, I finally decided to build it myself. Fortunately, AI came to the rescue to help me with the heavy lifting.

Please forgive me if this script isn't quite as good as it would be if it was written by someone with years of ZFS and bash coding experience, but it's the best I could do. This took me about three days and a few late nights of banging my head against the wall with the help (and sometimes against the help) of AI. Huge thanks to Cursor. While this script was developed with the help of multiple AI assistants, including Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT, I found Google's Gemini Pro to be significantly more precise.
